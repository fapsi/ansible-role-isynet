## FAQ
* Why should I use it?
> Administrating a windows server can be a pain, costly and involves much black box magic. By relying only on mssql for linux as a black box we can bypass or minimize some of this problems. 

> Scaling up the number of running instances. 

> Easier and more consistent desaster handling.
